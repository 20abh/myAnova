#' Compute Degrees of Freedom and Mean Squares
#'
#' This function computes the degrees of freedom and mean squares between and within groups for ANOVA.
#' @param data A data frame containing the dataset.
#' @param factor A string specifying the name of the factor variable column.
#' @param ss_between A numeric value for the sum of squares between groups.
#' @param ss_within A numeric value for the sum of squares within groups.
#' @return A list containing degrees of freedom (df_between, df_within) and mean squares (ms_between, ms_within).
#' @examples
