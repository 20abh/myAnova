#' Compute Sum of Squares
#'
#' This function computes the sum of squares between groups (SSB) and within groups (SSW) for a given dataset.
#' @param data A data frame containing the dataset.
#' @param response A string specifying the name of the response variable column.
#' @param factor A string specifying the name of the factor variable column.
#' @return A list containing the sum of squares between groups (SSB) and within groups (SSW).
